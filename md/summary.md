## That's it, folks!

I hope this was a useful introduction to wavelets and Discrete Wavelet Transformation. At the same time, it only scratches the surface of what is possible with wavelets, different type of transformations that can be applied and more. If Wavelet for Kids was too easy, you can always go for the real thing - [Statistical Modeling by Wavelets by Brani Vidakovich](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~brani/scale/bank/StatisticalModelingbyWavelets.pdf) or other resources available. 

This guide used [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for all wavelet transformation code. In case you are more of an R user, it has packages including [wavelets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavelets/index.html) and [waveslim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/waveslim/index.html). 

I would like to thank Professor [JC Lu](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/jye-chyi-lu) for introducing me to wavelets and the [COX Communications](https://www.cox.com/aboutus/home.html) data science team who kindly allowed me to use signal data in this guide.
