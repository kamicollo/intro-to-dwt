### What is a wavelet, anyway?

Discrete Wavelet Transformation, in a nutshell, is a decomposition of a signal into multiple components represented by a base wavelet shape. At this point, it's probably fair to ask - what's a wavelet? Wikipedia's definition is actually quite intuitive: 

>A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases or decreases, and then returns to zero one or more times.

There are multiple wavelet shapes one may use (and, in fact, you can even create your own wavelets as long as they satisfy certain mathematical properties). Here are some examples.
